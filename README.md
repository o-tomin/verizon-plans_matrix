# ‚öôÔ∏è Role-Based Access Configuration

This repository hosts the **central configuration file** (`plans_matrix.yml`) for defining **feature accessibility** across different **Plans** and **User Roles** in a role-based feature access system.

It is intended to be publicly available (via **GitHub Pages**) so that client applications can load and interpret access rules dynamically ‚Äî without recompiling or redeploying code.

---

## üß© Overview

The configuration defines:
- **Plans:** Free, Basic, Premium  
- **Roles:** Parent, Child, Member  
- **Features:** Calls, ScreenTime, Location  
- **Access Matrix:** Specifies which role can access which feature depending on plan and target user

Example use case:
| Acting Role | Target Role | Plan | Visible Features |
|--------------|--------------|------|------------------|
| Parent | Child | Free | Calls |
| Parent | Child | Premium | Calls, ScreenTime, Location |
| Member | Self | Basic | Calls |
| Member | Parent | Any | *(None)* |

## üß± Config File

The configuration file is written in **YAML** for human readability and scalability.
